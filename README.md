# Machine_Learning_For_Sanskrit

This is an upcoming project. Everyone knows sanskrit was one of the greatest languages spoken for many generations. Due to sanskrit being the mode of communication for so many years, it has given birth to so many texts and literatures that can provide solutions to many of the current issues the world is facing. 

## So, what this project mean for the sanskrit enthusiasts?

This project can help identify many of the forgotten logic and science behind the language and its vast huge number of literatures. For example:
* a sanskrit literature on Vaastu Shaastra contains huge number of scientific knowledge that can be applied in the field of construction. * The nyayashastra is a treatise on the science behind law and how it can be applied in various areas of law.

## How machine learning can help achieve this?

A simple treatise on the science behind the law or construction cannot be easily applied in the modern world.For this to be proved, we need to corroborate, simulate or predict the effects of the methods suggested in the various literatures and show that it is positive and better than the current methods we use. This is where machine learning comes in. We take huge data for various applications and then train the models based on the algorithms suggested in those literatures. If the score is better, then we suggest those methods to the outside world.

## What is the future scope for the project?

I had just started the project, I am going to open source this project and then build a tool based on the applications, which can later be applied to many domains.
